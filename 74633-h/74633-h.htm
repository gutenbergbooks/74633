<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Very</span> many years ago there
lived a noble Count, who
was one of the kindest and
best-hearted men in the world.
Every day in the year he gave to
the poor and helped the friendless,
but it was at the merry Christmas-time
that his goodness shone brightest.
He had even vowed a vow
that, as far as he was able to make
them so, every child he knew
should be happy Christmas-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>Early every Christmas morning
each boy and girl in the neighborhood
who was old enough, and not
too old, came to the castle of the
Count Cormo, and there the Count
and Countess welcomed them all,
rich or poor, and through the whole
day there were games, and festive
merry-making, and good things to
eat, and fun of every kind, and
besides all this, there was a grand
Christmas-tree, with a present on it
for each of the eager, happy youngsters
who stood around it.</p>

<p>But although the good Count had
a castle and rich lands, he gave away
so much money that he became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
poorer and poorer, so that at last he
and his wife often found it hard to
get the clothes and food they absolutely
needed.</p>

<p>But this made no difference with
the Christmas festivities. The Count
was not now able to be very generous
during the year, although he was
always willing to divide a meal with
a hungry person; but he managed
so that the children could have
their festival and their presents at
Christmas. Year by year he had
sold for this purpose some of the
beautiful things which the castle
contained, so that now there was
scarcely enough furniture left for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
the actual use of himself and the
Countess.</p>

<p>One night, about a week before
Christmas, the Count and his wife
sat in the great hall before a fire
smaller and poorer than those which
burned on the hearth of most of
the cottagers in the surrounding
country, for the cottagers could go
into the woods and pick up sticks
and twigs, whereas the Count had
sold all his forests, so that he could
not cut wood; and he had only one
old man for outdoor work, and he
had already picked up all the fallen
branches within a wide circuit of
the castle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>“Well, one thing is certain,”
said the Countess Cormo, as she
drew her chair nearer to the
little pile of burning sticks, “and
that is that we can not have the
children here at Christmas this
year.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked the Count.</p>

<p>“Because we have nothing to
give them,” replied his wife. “We
have nothing for them to eat, nothing
to put on the tree, and no
money to buy anything. What would
be the good of their coming when
we have nothing at all for them?”</p>

<p>“But we must have something,”
said the Count. “Think of all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
years that we have had these
Christmas gatherings, and then
think how hard it would be, both
for us and the little ones, to give
them up now we are growing old;
and we may not be with the children
another year. There are yet
several days before Christmas; I can
sell something to-morrow, and we
can have the tree and everything
prepared in time. There will not
be so much to eat as usual, and
the presents will be smaller, but
it will be our good old Christmas
in spite of that.”</p>

<p>“I should like very much to
know what you are going to sell,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
asked the Countess. “I thought we
had already parted with everything
that we could possibly spare.”</p>

<p>“Not quite,” said the Count.
“There is our old family bedstead.
It is very large; it is made of the
most valuable woods, and it is inlaid
with gold and silver. It will
surely bring a good price.”</p>

<p>“Sell the family bedstead!” cried
the Countess. “The bedstead on
which your ancestors, for generations,
have slept and died! How
could you even think of such a
thing! And what are we going to
sleep on, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we can get along very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
well,” said the Count. “There is a
small bedstead which you can have,
and I will sleep on the floor. I
would much rather do that than
have the children disappointed at
Christmas-time.”</p>

<p>“On the floor! at your age!” exclaimed
the Countess. “It will be
the death of you! But if you have
made up your mind, I suppose
there is no use in my saying anything
more about it.”</p>

<p>“Not the least in the world,”
replied her husband, with a smile;
and so she said no more.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> was on the morning of
the next day that there
came through the forest,
not very far from the Count
Cormo’s castle, a tall young giant.
As he strode along, he appeared
to be talking to the forefinger of
his right hand, which he held up
before him. He was not, however,
talking to his forefinger, but to a
little fairy who was sitting on it,
chatting away in a very lively
manner.</p>

<p>“And so,” said this little creature,
“you are two hundred miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
from your own home! What in the
world made you take so long a
journey?”</p>

<p>“I don’t call it very long,” replied
the giant; “and I had to take
it. There was nothing else to do.
You see I have nothing to eat, or
almost nothing, in my castle, and
a person can’t get along that way.
He must go and see about things.”</p>

<p>“And what are you going to see
about?” asked the fairy.</p>

<p>“I am going to see if my grandfather’s
uncle is dead. He is very
rich and I am one of his heirs.
When I get my share of his money,
I shall be quite comfortable.”</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">THE YOUNG GIANT WAS TALKING TO A LITTLE FAIRY
PERCHED ON HIS FOREFINGER</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>“It seems to me,” said the fairy,
“that it is a very poor way of
living, to be waiting for other people’s
money.”</p>

<p>“It is so,” replied the giant. “I’m
tired of it. I’ve been waiting ever
since I was a little boy.”</p>

<p>The fairy saw that her companion
had not exactly understood
her remark, but she said no more
about it. She merely added, “It
seems strange to hear you say that
you once were little.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I was,” said the giant.
“At one time I was no taller than
a horse.”</p>

<p>“Astonishing!” said the fairy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
making believe to be very much
surprized. “Now, when I was a
baby, I was about the size of a
pea.”</p>

<p>This made the giant laugh, but
he said he supposed it must have
been so, considering the present
size, and then he said: “Talking
of peas reminds me that I am hungry.
We must stop somewhere, and
ask for something to eat.”</p>

<p>“That will suit me very well,
but don’t let us go to the same
place,” said the fairy. “I expect
you are dreadfully hungry.”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied the other.
“There is a great house over in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
the valley, not more than fifteen
miles away. I’ll just step over there,
and you can go to Count Cormo’s
castle. I’ll take you to the edge
of the woods. When you’ve had
your dinner, come back to this oak,
and I’ll meet you; I’ve heard the
Count is getting very poor, but
he’ll have enough for you.”</p>

<p>So the giant put the fairy down
on the ground, and she skipped
along to the castle, while he
stepped over to the house in the
valley.</p>

<p>In an hour or two they met
again at the great oak, and, the
giant taking up his little friend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
on his forefinger, they continued
their journey.</p>

<p>“You told me that Count Cormo
was poor,” she said, “but I don’t
believe you know how poor he really
is. When I went there, he and
his wife had just finished their dinner,
and were sitting before the
fire-place. I didn’t notice any fire
in it. They were busy talking, and
so I did not disturb them, but just
climbed up on the table to see
what I could find to eat. You
haven’t any idea what a miserable
meal they must have had. Of
course there was enough left for
me, for I need only a few crumbs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
but everything was so hard and
stale that I could scarcely eat it.
I don’t see how they can live in
that way. But after the meal, when
I heard them talking, I found out
how poor they really were.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t exactly the proper
thing to sit there and listen to
them, was it?” asked the giant.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” said the fairy,
“but I did want to hear what they
were saying. So I sat quite still.
They were talking about the Christmas-tree,
and all the other good
things they give the children every
year; and although they are so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
poor, they are going to do just
the same this year.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how they can,” said
the giant.</p>

<p>“The Count is going to sell his
family bedstead,” replied his companion.</p>

<p>The young giant stopped short
in the path.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say,” he
exclaimed, “that the celebrated
family bedstead of the Cormo
family is to be sold to give the
children a Christmas-tree!”</p>

<p>“That is exactly what I mean,”
replied the fairy.</p>

<p>“Well, well, well!” said the giant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
resuming his walk. “I never heard
of such a thing in all my born
days. It’s dreadful; it’s pitiful!”</p>

<p>“Indeed it is,” said the fairy.</p>

<p>“It ought to be stopped,” added
the giant. “He shouldn’t be allowed
to do such a thing.”</p>

<p>“Indeed he shouldn’t,” the fairy
said.</p>

<p>And thus they went on lamenting
and regretting the poor Count’s
purpose, for about eleven miles.
Then they came to a cross-road
through the forest.</p>

<p>“I’ll go down here,” said the
giant, “and leave you among your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
friends at Fairy Elms, where you
want to go.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure that I do want
to go there just now,” said the
fairy. “I think I should like to
go with you to your grandfather’s
uncle’s castle, and see what your
prospects are. If you find he is
still alive, shall you wait?”</p>

<p>“I guess not,” said the giant,
laughing. “But you can come
along with me, and we’ll see how
things stand.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Before</span> very long, they
came to a great castle,
and a warder stood before
the gate.</p>

<p>“Ho, warder!” cried the giant
when he came up. “How goes it
with my grandfather’s uncle, the
old giant Omscrag?”</p>

<p>“He has been dead a month,”
said the warder, “and his property
is all divided among his heirs.”</p>

<p>“That is not so,” roared the
giant. “I am one of his heirs, and
I haven’t got anything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about
it,” said the warder. “I was told
to give that message to every one
who came, and I’ve given it to
you.”</p>

<p>“Who told you to give it?”
cried the giant.</p>

<p>“My master, Katofan, who is the
old giant’s principal heir, and who
now owns the castle.”</p>

<p>“Katofan!” exclaimed the giant.
“What impudence! He’s a ninth
cousin by marriage. Where is he?
I want to see him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he is well enough
to see anybody to-day,” said the
warder.</p>

THE SICK GIANT’S CASTLE-GATE</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>“Open that gate!” the giant
roared, “or I shall plunge your
family into woe!”</p>

<p>The warder turned pale, and
opened the gate as wide as it
would go, while the giant, with the
fairy on his finger, walked boldly
in.</p>

<p>In a large inner hall, sitting before
a great fire, they saw a giant
so tall and thin that he looked as
if he had been made of great fishing-poles.
He turned uneasily in
his chair when he saw his visitor,
and was going to say something
about being too unwell to receive
company, when our young giant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
whose name was Feldar, interrupted
him by calling out, in a tremendous
voice:</p>

<p>“Well, now, Katofan, I should
like to know what all this means!
How did you come to be heir to
this castle?”</p>

<p>“Because it descended to me from
my good old relative and friend,”
said the other.</p>

<p>“I expect there are a hundred
heirs, who have a better right to
it than you,” said our giant. “The
truth is, no doubt, that you were
here when my grandfather’s uncle
died, and that you took possession,
and have since kept everybody out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said the thin giant,
“the other heirs have had a share
of the fortune.”</p>

<p>“How many of them?” said Feldar,
“and how much did they get?”</p>

<p>“As many as two or three of
them,” said the other, “and they
got some very nice things in the
way of ornaments and curiosities.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Feldar, stretching
himself up high, “I am one of the
heirs to this property, and I want
my share of it. Who attends to
the dividing business? Do you do
it yourself?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” said the thin giant.
“I am not well enough for that.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
I cannot go about much. But I
will send for my dividing-agent. I
had to employ one, there was so
much to do. He will see that you
get your share.”</p>

<p>He then rang a bell, and a small
man appeared. When the fairy saw
him, she could not help laughing,
but her laugh was such a little one
that no one noticed it. He had a
bushy head of hair, which was as
black as ink on one side and as
white as milk on the other. Looking
at him from one side, he
seemed quite young, and from the
other side, quite old.</p>

<p>“Flipkrak,” said the thin giant,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>“this is another heir to this property;
we overlooked him when we
made our division. I wish you
would take him, as you did the
others, and let him choose something
that he would like to have.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Flipkrak. “This
way, good sir,” and he went out
of a side-door, followed closely by
Feldar.</p>

<p>“How would you like a hinge?”
cried the thin giant, as they
reached the door. “There are some
very handsome and odd hinges,
nearly new. If you take one, you
might some day get another to
match it, and then you would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
a nice pair all ready when you
put up a new door.”</p>

<p>Feldar stopped a moment in the
doorway.</p>

<p>“I’ll look at them,” he answered,
and then went on.</p>

<p>“Here, good sir,” said Flipkrak,
showing the young giant into a
large room, “is a collection of most
beautiful articles. You can choose
any one of them, or even two if
you like. They will be admirable
mementos of your deceased relative.”</p>

<p>Feldar looked around. There
were all sorts of brass and iron
ornaments, old pieces of furniture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
and various odds and ends, of little
value.</p>

<p>“A nice lot of rubbish,” said the
young giant. “If I ever have any
holes to fill up, on my ground, I
may send for a few wagon-loads
of it. Suppose we look through
the rest of the castle?”</p>

<p>“Oh, good sir,” said the dividing-agent,
“the things in the rest of
the castle belong to my good master!”</p>

<p>“You can come if you choose,”
said Feldar, striding away, “or you
can stay behind,” and the poor
man, frightened, ran after him as
fast as he could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>The young giant walked through
several of the vast rooms of the
castle. “I see you have a great
deal of very fine furniture here,” he
said to Flipkrak, “and I need furniture.
I will mark some of it with
this piece of chalk, and you can
send it to me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, good sir,” cried the
dividing-agent, quite pleased at this.
“We can send it to you after you
go away.”</p>

<p>Feldar took a piece of chalk
from his pocket, and marked
enough furniture to furnish an ordinary
castle.</p>

<p>“This kind of chalk will not rub<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
off,” he said, “and I’ve marked the
things where it won’t show. But
don’t overlook any of them. Now,
where are your money-vaults?”</p>

<p>“Oh, good sir!” cried the dividing-agent,
“you can’t go there, we
don’t divide any of–I mean we
haven’t any money-vaults!”</p>

<p>“Give me the key,” said Feldar.</p>

<p>“Oh, good sir!” cried Flipkrak,
shaking with terror, “I must not
let that go out of my keeping–I
mean I haven’t got it.”</p>

<p>The giant made no answer, but
taking the dividing-agent by the
heels, he held him upside down in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
the air, and shook him. A big
key dropped from his pockets.</p>

<p>“That’s the key, no doubt,” said
the giant, putting the man down,
and picking up the key. “I can
find the vault by myself. I won’t
trouble you any more.”</p>

<p>But as he went down to the
lower parts of the castle, the dividing-agent
ran after him, wailing
and tearing his two-colored hair.</p>
<br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">THE YOUNG GIANT’S WAY OF GETTING THE KEY</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>When he reached the money-vault,
Feldar easily opened the door
and walked in. Great bags of gold
and silver, each holding about a
bushel, were piled up around the
walls. Feldar took out his piece
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>of chalk, and marked about a dozen
of those bags which held the gold
coin.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s right, good sir,” cried
Flipkrak, feeling a little better. “We
can send them to you after you
go away.”</p>

<p>“What is in those small bags,
on that shelf?” asked Feldar.</p>

<p>“Those are diamonds, good sir,”
said the agent; “you can mark some
of them if you like.”</p>

<p>“I will mark one,” said the giant
to the fairy, who was securely
nestled in the ruffles of his shirtbosom,
“and that I will give to
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>“To me!” exclaimed Flipkrak,
who did not see the fairy; “what
does he mean by that?”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the little
creature, in delight. “Diamonds
are so lovely! How glad I am that
your grandfather’s uncle died!”</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t say that,” said
the giant. “It isn’t proper.”</p>

<p>“But you feel glad, don’t you?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t talk about it, if I do,”
said Feldar. Then turning to the
dividing-agent, he told him that he
thought he had marked all the
bags he wanted.</p>

<p>“All right, good sir,” said Flipkrak,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
“we will send them to you,
very soon–very soon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you needn’t trouble yourself
about that,” said Feldar; “I will
take them along with me.” And
so saying, he put the bag of diamonds
in one of his coat-pockets,
and began to pile the bags of
money on his shoulders.</p>

<p>The dividing-agent yelled and
howled with dismay, but it was of
no use. Feldar loaded himself with
his bags, and walked off, without
even looking at Flipkrak, who was
almost crazy at seeing so much of
his master’s treasure boldly taken
away from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>Feldar stopped for a moment in
the great hall, where the thin giant
was still sitting before the fire.</p>

<p>“I’ve taken my share of the
money,” he said, “and I’ve marked
a lot of furniture and things which
I want you to send me, inside of
a week. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>The thin giant gave one look
at the piles of bags on Feldar’s
shoulders, and fainted away. He
had more money left than he could
possibly use, but he could not bear
to lose the least bit of the wealth
he had seized upon.</p>

<p>“What in the world are you going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
to do with all that money?”
the fairy asked.</p>

<p>“I am going to give one bag
of it to Count Cormo, so that he
can offer the children a decent
Christmas-tree, and the rest I shall
carry to my castle on Shattered
Crag.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe the Count will
take it,” said the fairy. “He’s awfully
proud, and he would say that
you were giving the Christmas
feasts and not he. I wish you
would let me manage this affair for
you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will,” said the giant.</p>

<p>“All right,” cried the fairy, clapping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
her hands. “I’ll do the thinking
and you can do the working.
It’s easy for me to think.”</p>

<p>“And it’s just as easy for me
to work,” said Feldar, with hearty
good-will.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> day before Christmas,
poor Count Cormo sat,
quite disconsolate, in his
castle-hall, before a hearth where
there was no fire. He had sold
his family bedstead, but he had
received very little money for it.
People said such old bedsteads were
not worth much, even if they were
inlaid with precious metals. So he
had been able only to prepare a
small tree, on which he had hung
the cheapest kind of presents, and
his feast was very plain and simple.
The Countess, indeed, was afraid
the things would not go around,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
for their old servant had told them
that he had heard there would be
more children at the castle the next
day than had ever been there before.
She was in favor of giving
up the whole affair and of sending
the children home as soon as they
should come.</p>


<p>“What is the use,” she said, “of
having them here, when we have
so little to give them? They will
get more at home; and then if they
don’t come we shall have the things
for ourselves.”</p>

<p>“No, no, my dear,” said the
Count; “this may be the last time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
that we shall have the children with
us, for I do not see how we can
live much longer in this sorrowful
condition, but the dear girls and
boys must come to-morrow. I
should not wish to die knowing
that we had missed a Christmas.
We must do the best with what
we have, and I am sure we can
make them happy if we try. And
now let us go to bed, so as to be
up early to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The Countess sighed. There was
only one little bedstead, and the
poor Count had to sleep on the
floor.</p>

<p>Christmas-day dawned bright,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
clear, and sparkling. The Count
was in good spirits.</p>

<p>“It is a fine day,” he said to
his wife, “and that is a great thing
for us.”</p>

<p>“We need all we can get,” said
the Countess, “and it is well for
us that fine days do not cost anything.”</p>

<p>Very soon the Count heard the
sound of many merry voices, and
his eyes began to sparkle.</p>

<p>“They are coming!” he cried, and
threw open the door of the castle,
and went to meet his little guests;
but when he saw them he started
back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>“What do you think?” he exclaimed
to the Countess, who stood
behind him. “There is a long
procession of them, and they are
headed by a giant–the young
giant Feldar! Who ever heard of
such a thing as a giant coming
to a children’s festival! He will
eat up everything we have in a
few mouthfuls!”</p>

<p>“You might as well let him do
it!” said the Countess. “There won’t
be enough for the others, anyway.
There seem to be hundreds of them;
and if there isn’t a band of music
striking up!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, quite a procession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
was approaching the castle. First
came the giant Feldar, with Tillette,
the little fairy, on his finger;
then four or five musicians; and
after them a long line of children,
all dressed in their best clothes,
and marching two by two.</p>

<p>“Merry Christmas!” shouted the
giant, as soon as he saw Count
Cormo, and then all the children
shouted “Merry Christmas!” until
the castle courtyard echoed with
the cheerful greeting, while the
band played loudly and merrily.</p>
<br>

  <img class="w100" src="images/image059.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">QUITE A PROCESSION WAS APPROACHING THE CASTLE</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>“Come in, my dears,” cried the
Count to the children. “I am glad
to see you. But as for you, good
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>giant, I fear my door is not quite
large enough. But perhaps you can
stoop and squeeze yourself in.”</p>

<p>“Count Cormo!” cried the fairy,
from the giant’s finger. “I have
a plan to propose.”</p>

<p>The good Count looked up in
surprize.</p>

<p>“If it isn’t a dear little fairy!”
he exclaimed. “Why, certainly, if
you have a plan to propose, I shall
be happy to hear it.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said Tillette, “suppose
we go first into the great hall
in the old wing of the castle. That
is so large that it will hold us all,
and we can have a grand dance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
if we feel like it, after we get
there.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid that the great hall
would be very uncomfortable,” said
the Count. “No one has lived in
it, nor even entered it, so far as
I know, for many years; and everything
must be covered with dust
and cobwebs.”</p>

<p>“But it would be so nice to
march around that great hall, with
the music and everything. I don’t
believe there’s any dust.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said the Count, “as
you seem to have set your heart
on it, we’ll go.”</p>

<p>So the Count and the Countess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
put on their hats and took their
places in the procession, at the
head of the line of children and
just behind the musicians. Then
they all marched across the great
courtyard to the old wing of the
castle, and when they reached the
doors of the great hall, the giant
swung them open, and everybody
entered.</p>

<p>Never were there two such
astonished people as the Count and
the Countess!</p>

<p>Right in the middle of the hall
stood a great Christmas-tree, which
the giant had brought in on his
shoulders from the woods. On the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
wide-spreading branches of this tall
tree were hung hundreds of presents
and sparkling ornaments.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” gasped
the Count. “Whose tree is this?”</p>

<p>“It is yours! It is yours!” cried
all the children in a merry chorus
which made the old walls ring. “It
is your Christmas-tree, and we, the
children, who love you, give it to
you!”</p>

<p>The Count looked around from
one to another of the children, but
did not say a word. His heart
was too full for him to speak.
Then the giant put the fairy
on his shirt-frill, and, stooping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
down, took up the Count and
Countess, one in each hand, holding
them gently but very firmly, and
carried them around the tree, raising
them up and down, so that
they could see all the presents, even
those at the very top.</p>

<p>Everything was labeled–not
with the name of the person they
were for, for they were all for the
Count and Countess, but with the
names of those who gave them.</p>

<p>Presently, the Count began to
read every name aloud, and each
time a child’s name was called, all
the other children would clap and
cheer. There were a good many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
small bags, which looked as if they
were very heavy, hanging here and
there, and these were all marked
“From Feldar,” while some beautiful
clusters of diamonds, which glittered
in the sunlight that poured in
through the windows, were labeled
“From Tillette.”</p>

<p>It took a long time to look at
all the presents, which were rather
different from the things generally
seen on Christmas-trees, for the
great branches and boughs held
every kind of useful and ornamental
articles that the Count and Countess
needed. Many of these were old
family treasures which they once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
had owned, but had been obliged
to sell, to keep up their Christmas
festivals.</p>

<p>The Count and his wife were
more and more delighted as they
were carried around the tree, but
at last this happy business was
over, and the giant put them down
upon the floor.</p>

<p>“Now for a dance!” cried the
fairy, in her clear little voice, and
the music struck up, while all the
children began to dance gayly
around the tree.</p>

<p>The Count and Countess, with
the giant and the fairy, stood aside
while this happy play was going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
on, enjoying it almost as much as
the children, but when the dancing
began to flag, the Count thought
that the time had now come when
the party ought to have something
to eat, and his heart failed him
when he thought of the very
meager repast he had to offer them.</p>

<p>But he need not have troubled
his mind about that. As soon as
the dance was done, the giant
stepped to a door which led to
another apartment, and throwing it
open he cried:</p>

<p>“Enter the banqueting-hall! This
is the feast the children give to
the good Count Cormo and his wife.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
He has feasted them often and
often, and made them happy for
many a Christmas. It is their turn
now.”</p>

<p>Everybody trooped through the
door, the children gently pushing
the Count and Countess before them.
The room was truly a banqueting-hall.
A long table was covered
with every kind of thing good to
eat, and, on smaller tables in the
corners, was ever so much more,
in case it should be needed. Here
and there, on the long table were
enormous cakes, great bowls of jelly,
and vast pies. Everybody knew
these were for the giant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>The Count and Countess took
their places at the head and foot
of the table; and all the children
gathered around, and everybody had
a splendid appetite. Just in the
center of the table there was a little
table about three inches high, on
which there were dear little morsels
of the dainties the others were eating.
At this table, on a little chair,
the fairy Tillette sat, where she
could see everything, and she enjoyed
herself as much as anybody
else did.</p>
<br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">THE COUNT AND HIS HAPPY GUESTS ENJOY THE CHRISTMAS FEAST</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>When the banquet was over, they
all went into the great hall, where
they had dances and games and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>singing, and there never was a merrier
company before.</p>

<p>When evening approached the
Count stood up and made a little
speech. He tried to tell the children
how good he thought they
were, and how happy they had
made him. He did not say much,
but they all understood him. When
he had finished there was a silence
over the whole room. The children
looked at one another, some of
them smiled, and then, all together,
as if they had planned it out before,
they cried:</p>

<p>“The giant and the fairy did it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
all. He gave us the money and
she told us what to buy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw!” said the young
giant, his face turning very red; “I
thought nothing was to be said
about that,” and he went outside
so that nobody should make a
speech to him.</p>

<p>Now all the children came up,
and each in turn bade the Count
and Countess farewell, and then,
headed by the giant’s band of
music, and singing merrily, they
marched away to their homes.</p>

<p>But Count Cormo would not let
the giant and the fairy go away
so soon. He made them come with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
him to the dwelling part of his
castle, and there, after a little
squeezing and stooping by the
giant, at the door, they all sat
down around the hearth, on which
a fine blazing fire had been built.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to say, my
dear Feldar,” said the Count, “and
I can never repay you––”</p>

<p>The giant was just about to exclaim
that the Count need not say
anything, and that he did not wish
to be repaid, when, seeing he felt
embarrassed, the fairy broke in:</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, dear Count, you can
repay him. You can adopt him.
You have no children, you are getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
old, and are living alone. He
has no parents,–even his grandfather’s
uncle is now dead,–and he
lives all by himself in his castle on
the Shattered Crag. He is rich,
and you can show him how to do
good with his great wealth. He
could come and live in the old
wing of the castle, where the rooms
are so large; the furniture he has
inherited could be sent here, and
you could all be so happy together!
Will you take him?”</p>

<p>The Count’s eyes filled with
tears.</p>

<p>“Would you like us to adopt
you?” he said to Feldar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>
<br>

<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>“Indeed I should,” was the reply.
Then the young giant kneeled on
the floor; and the Count got up on
a table, and put his hands on the
young giant’s head, and adopted
him.</p>

<p>“Now you ought to adopt her,”
said Feldar, after he had kissed the
Count and the Countess, and had
sat down again by the fire.</p>

<p>“No,” said Tillette, “I can not
be adopted. But I will often come
to see you, and we shall be happy
together, and the children will have
a splendid Christmas festival every
year.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>“As long as we live,” said the
Count and Countess.</p>

<p>“As long as I live,” said Feldar.</p>

<p>When the Count and Countess
went up to their room, that night,
there they found the family bedstead,
all cleaned and polished, with
its gold and silver ornaments sparkling
like new.</p>

<p>“What a happy Christmas I have
had!” said good Count Cormo.
